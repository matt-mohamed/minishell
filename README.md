# minishell
Minishell is a minimalist, Unix-style command-line interpreter written in C. It is designed to mimic basic functionalities of a traditional shell, making it an excellent project for understanding system calls, process management, and command parsing in Unix environments.

Built-in Commands: Implements essential commands such as cd (change directory) and exit (terminate the session). Additional built-ins can be integrated as needed.

External Command Execution: Uses system calls (e.g., fork(), exec(), wait()) to execute external commands.

Environment Variable Handling: Reads and utilizes environment variables to manage the shell environment.

Error Handling: Checks for errors during command execution and provides feedback to the user.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you compile and run the minishell on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Operating System: Unix/Linux or any environment that provides a POSIX-compliant shell.

Compiler: A C compiler such as GCC.
